They still accept customer after 8:30pm unlike the other Japanese resto beside them which by the way was our first choice.<br><br>Food is great and reasonably priced. Will go back and try other items in the menu."

        review_description: "Fantastic spot for a healthy brunch! The toasties were wonderfully crunchy and full of flavor, although a tad heavy on the rock salt. The salad, dressed with a delightful strawberry vinaigrette, showcased a blend of fresh, delectable greens. While the pumpkin soup leaned towards the healthier side (slightly on the bland side, if I may add) the attentive service was consistent as usual. Looking forward to returning for more of their nutritious brunch options."

        review_description: "I recently dined at The Wholesome Table and I'm happy to give it a solid 4 stars. The food was generally good across the board. The chicken inasal was a standout, being tender and flavorful.<br><br>However, there was a slight disappointment with the pork chops. The portion size seemed a bit reduced compared to what I expected. The pizza, pasta, and salmon bowl were decent but didn't particularly stand out in the same way as the chicken inasal.<br><br>Service at The Wholesome Table was commendable. The staff was attentive and friendly, but be prepared for a bit of a wait for your food. It's worth it, though, for the quality of the meal.<br><br>The ambiance of the restaurant is truly impressive. The interior, with its combination of wood, live trees, and plants, creates a welcoming and refreshing atmosphere. It's a great environment that complements the wholesome theme of the restaurant.<br><br>In summary, The Wholesome Table offers a good dining experience with some standout dishes and a beautiful setting. It's a place I'd recommend for anyone looking for a meal that feels both healthy and satisfying."
